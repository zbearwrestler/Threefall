Threefall Game (BC Game Jam 2017)
Apr 2017 â€“ Apr 2017

Project descriptionBC Game Jam is an annual event that is hosted in the city of Vancouver, in which various teams are 
competing to create the best game possible within 48 hours. In this particular project, we were given the task to create 
a game with the theme of "dimension". Our team consisted of 8 people and used various software programs like Unity, C#, 
and Adobe to design and create the game. The game was about a young man with a laser pistol, in which he needs to survive 
by killing every single enemy, as well as facing a weird dimension that was set in the game -- the enemies and the players 
could walk through the wall and suddenly went into another level. My role in this project was to create the AI enemy using Unity. 
Although our team didn't win the competition, we were quite satisfied with what we did, for the game was working properly.
